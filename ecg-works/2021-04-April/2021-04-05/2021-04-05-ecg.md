Greetings Everyone and welecome to the ECG workout for the week of April 5th, 2021. Its Amal Mattu at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Once again, welcome back to this weeks workout. Well this week we have got two cases that focus on a single theme and both are coming to us from the great white north - from Canada. Just above the north

   CASE#1

      - Caraquet, New Brunswick, Canada
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First case is sent by Dr Audrey Anne Gauvin. Hope I am getting your name correct. Audrey Anne works in Caraquet New Brunswick Canada. You know what - one of the things I like doing these cases is taking a look at where people are from. Now I kinda have a sense of where New Brunswick is. New Brunswick is way up here - north of maine. But where exactly is caraquet? I took up some pictures of the tourism board and I took some really nice pictures of a quaint little village or town to take a look at. Now these pictures were taken during the summer. Now, based on the location - I am guessing that they have some really cold weather also. Anyway, she sent this case in .

   CASE#1
   
   *) 69 y/o W presents with CP + SOB - ECG... 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

taking care of a 69 year old woman. She has been complaining about some chest pain (CP) + and shortness of breath (SOB). My hope is for you to look at this 12 lead ECG 

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sashank786monitrahealth/clinical-stuffs/main/ecg-works/2021-04-April/2021-04-05/2021-04-05-001.png)


... and nail the diagnosis right from the start. Now take a look at this, first of all the computer interpretation up there calling it atrial fibrillation and that is probably because it is a little bit irregular but now if you take a look at the baseline you clearly see p waves in here 


![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sashank786monitrahealth/clinical-stuffs/main/ecg-works/2021-04-April/2021-04-05/2021-04-05-002-pwaves.png)


Now this is an example of computer just miscalling this. The voltage out here in big circle is maybe a little bit low:

And there is some non-specific junk and kind of a wavy baseline but hopefully whatever here is seen *there is some ST-segment elevation* in V1, AVR and also in lead 3. 

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sashank786monitrahealth/clinical-stuffs/main/ecg-works/2021-04-April/2021-04-05/2021-04-05-004-S-T-elevation.png)

... then some other non specific chunk. There is ST segment depression in Lead 1, little ST depression in AVL. There is some reciprocal changes and some flattening elsewhere. But, my question to you is - *What type of STEMI produces ST segment elevation in V1, aVR and lead III?*

That is, where does it localize in the heart? Which vessel is involved in the heart? Lets move forward a bit - if you have not got the diagnosis yet - take a look at the history 


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SLIDE2 >> 
 
   CASE#1
   
   *) 69 y/o W presents with CP + SOB - ECG... 
   *) Sx's x 5 days, worse today...
   *) RR 30, 90 - 92% on 100% NRB
   *) Lungs CTA, CXR normal
   *) TN normal
   *) BNP and D-dimer are elevated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. it is always fair to give the history because you always want to interpret the EKG in association with a reasonable history. So, here is the history - I cannot hide that any longer. So this patient, has been having symptoms for 5 days. And they got worse today. Respiratory rate is 30 - so that is concerning, pulse oxymeter is 90 to 92% on 100% Non-Rebreather. Maybe this patient with a STEMI has developed pulmonary edema but the lungs were clear to auscultation. Chest X-Ray was normal also. So hopefully you are heading in the proper direction. TN (troponin) is unremarkable. The BNP and D-dimer are elevated and so by this point - think, probably everyone is nailing the diagnosis.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SLIDE2 >> 
 
   CASE#1
   
   *) 69 y/o W presents with CP + SOB - ECG... 
   *) Presumptive dx PE
   *) Transferred (on heparin) to nearest CT scanner ...
      30 - 40 minutes away
   *) Dx: massive bilateral PE with right heart strain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

... presumptive diagonisis (dx) is a massive PE and is very common with elevated BNP's and large PE's and probably you inspect a bump in troponin also but later the patient also bumped the troponin. These are all signs of ventricular strain that produces elevated BNP and the rise in troponin. Audrey Ann works in a place where the nearest cat scanner is ... beleive it or not... 30 to 40 minutes away. All of here is the US really get spoiled by having CAT scanners... multiple CAT scanners sometimes in the same hospital .. she is gotta send her patient 30 to 40 minutes away just to get a CAT scanner .. that is exactly what she did. She put the patient on heparin and sent him to CAT scanner. And fortunately, the patient ended up doing OK with heparin. Now some of you might be saying - well, if you have a bed side ultrasound you can make this diagnois and that is probably true. This is not called Ultrasound workout, this is called ECG workout. So we are not going to talk about ultrasound. By all means if you have an ultrasound. It will be very helpful also. But, I really want you to look at EKG's and say to yourself.

Hey, there is ST segment elevation in the leads that are looking at the right side of the heart. Specifically, V1, AVR . Sometimes, you see in V2 also. Sometimes, you see in Lead III. 

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sashank786monitrahealth/clinical-stuffs/main/ecg-works/2021-04-April/2021-04-05/2021-04-05-005-Four-Leads-PE.png)

So those are the four leads in my mind which tell me - I have gotta worry - right heart strain. Now also, when you try to localize this for a coronary artery. There is no coronary artery that I am aware of. Maybe I am wrong, but, there is no coronary artery that I am aware of that gives you ST elevation in AVR, V1 and in the lead III. The artery that this localizes to is the pulmonary artery - not the coronary artery. So remember your differentials for ST segment elevation:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SLIDE3 >> 
 
   DDx of STE

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| Diagnosis | indication |
| :--- | :---: |
| Acute myocardial injury (ACO or trauma) | High voltage (eg. LVH, WPW, athlete's heart, etc.) |
| Global Ischemia (eg EPI, dissection, massive GIB, etc.) | Na+ channelopathies, eg. TCAs, hyperK+, Brugada, etc. |
| Early Repolarization | Post-cardioversion (stunning)|
| Myo/pericarditis | Hypothermia |
| Vasospasm | Tako tsubo |
| Ventricular aneurysm | Intracranial abnls |
| LBBB / pacemaker | Spiked Hemet sign |
| Pulmonary Embolism | Hypercalcemia |

There are a lot of things that produce a ST segment elevation. And one of them is pulmonary embolism.Always got to keep them in the differential. When you see something that has to do with chest pain, shortness of breath and ST elevation. Just think STEMI you have got to think about PE also and then we have talked about this this before as well. Differential for ST Elevation in aVR. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SLIDE4 >> 
 
   DDx for STE in aVR
   (with STD in other leads)

* ACS: LMCA, triple vessel, and prox LAD disease
* Any other causes of global cardiac ischemia
   - TAD, severe anemia, early post-arrest (w/i 15 minutes of EPI or shocks)
* Massive PE 
* LVH with strain, esp. with severe htn
* LBBB, pacers
* SVTs (esp. AVRT)
* Severe hypoK+
* Sodium channel pathology (incl. TCAs, hyperK+, Brugada, etc.)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PE can produce ST elevation in aVR as well. Every one just thinks about these bad players that produce elevation in AVR.

But there are others including massive PE. So just some key takehome points for case number 1.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SLIDE5 >> Key Points
 
   * Large PEs commonly mimic ACS on the ECG 
     - T-wave inversions
     - STE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

and we will hammer this home with case number 2. Large PE's commonly mimic ACS on the ECG. We have talked about T-wave inversions. Quite a few times. But don't forget about ST segment elevation. Now we have talked about ST elevation with PEs. Handful of times as well but it is still something that is easily forgotten. Typically, ST segment elevation will be typically in the leads that look at the right side of the heart. 



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SLIDE 6 >> Key Points
 
   * Large PEs commonly mimic ACS on the ECG 
     - T-wave inversions
     - STE --> typically in the leads that "look" at the right side of the heart. 
     * Usually V1 and AVR
     * +- V2, III
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What are those leads? Usually, it is going to be V1 and AVR. Sometimes, it will be V2 also. Sometimes, it will be lead III.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sashank786monitrahealth/clinical-stuffs/main/ecg-works/2021-04-April/2021-04-05/2021-04-05-007-Leads-STE.png)

In this particular case, those were the three leads that gave us the ST segment elevation. Alright. Now, in the past when we had talked about PE with ST segment elevation. Those cases in particular have a right axis deviation (RAD) and that makes the case diagnosis a lot easier. But you don't always have to have a right axis deviation


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SLIDE 7 >> Key Points
 
   * Large PEs commonly mimic ACS on the ECG 
     - T-wave inversions
     - STE --> typically in the leads that "look" at the right side of the heart. 
     * Usually V1 and AVR
     * +- V2, III
     * Often with RAD... but not always. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This patient obviously did not read the book or listen to our podcast or videocasts. She should have right axis deviation but she chose not to. So right axis deviation will make your diagnosis a lot easier. But is not always gonna be there.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SLIDE 8 - CASE 2
 
   * Courtesy Yann Sevigny
     - Paramedic, Montreal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alright, lets do another case and really hammer this home. So, this one was sent to us by a paramedic - Yann Sevigny. Again, I hope I am getting that name right. He is a paramedic from Quebec and he is currently.. here are some pictures of Montreal. Once again, a really really beautiful city. And he is actually taking classes in Montreal - trying to become a certified advanced paramedic. 


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SLIDE 9 - CASE 2
 
   * Courtesy Yann Sevigny
     - Paramedic, Montreal
     - Advanced paramedic student
     - Teacher - Sylvian Dufour
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yann also wanted to make sure to throw some props out to an outstanding teacher of his - Sylvain Dufour. I don't speak french and I am sorry if I am getting that name wrong. But Yann is really really impressed with the quality and hardwork of his teacher and wanted me to make sure that I mention his name and I am all about sending props out to great teachers out there. So keep up the great work.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SLIDE 10 - CASE 2
 
   * 26 yo W developed sudden malaise while laying in bed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So, Yann was taking care of this patient - a 26 year old woman who developed a certain malaise while laying in bed. Thats kind of like a new one. But apparently she was laying down and suddenly got a bamn ... and really reaaly got wiped out tired and could not get out of bed. She called the paramedics and out there. Medics arrive and by the time they got there she was a bit hypoxic and a bit agitated and cyanotic.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SLIDE 11 - CASE 2
 
   * 26 yo W developed sudden malaise while laying in bed
   * Medic arrive and find her agitated and cyanotic
   * ECG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

They got her 12 lead ECG.

And take a look at that - there is pattern. Once again.
