First case is sent by Dr Audrey Anne Gauvin. Hope I am getting your name correct. Audrey Anne works in Caraquet New Brunswick Canada. You know what - one of the things I like doing these cases is taking a look at where people are from. Now I kinda have a sense of where New Brunswick is. New Brunswick is way up here - north of maine. But where exactly is caraquet? I took up some pictures of the tourism board and I took some really nice pictures of a quaint little village or town to take a look at. Now these pictures were taken during the summer. Now, based on the location - I am guessing that they have some really cold weather also. Anyway, she sent this case in .
