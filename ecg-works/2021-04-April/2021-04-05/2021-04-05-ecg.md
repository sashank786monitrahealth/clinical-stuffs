My observation: ST segment elevation in leads 3
                ST segment depression in 1
                
Ask youself three questions:
########################################
1) Which leads have ST segment elevation?
2) What is your differential for ST segment abnormalities seen?
3) What is your most likely diagnosis?

Greetings Everyone and welecome to the ECG workout for the week of April 5th, 2021. Its Amal Mattu at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Once again, welcome back to this weeks workout. Well this week we have got two cases that focus on a single theme and both are coming to us from the great white north - from Canada. Just above the north

First case is sent by Dr Audrey Anne Gauvin. Hope I am getting your name correct. Audrey Anne works in Caraquet New Brunswick Canada. You know what - one of the things I like doing these cases is taking a look at where people are from. Now I kinda have a sense of where New Brunswick is. New Brunswick is way up here - north of maine. But where exactly is caraquet? I took up some pictures of the tourism board and I took some really nice pictures of a quaint little village or town to take a look at. Now these pictures were taken during the summer. Now, based on the location - I am guessing that they have some really cold weather also. Anyway, she sent this case in .

   *) 69 y/o W presents with CP + SOB - ECG... 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

taking care of a 69 year old woman. She has been complaining about some chest pain (CP) + and shortness of breath (SOB). My hope is for you to look at this 12 lead ECG

... and nail the diagnosis right from the start. Now take a look at this, first of all the computer interpretation up there calling it atrial fibrillation and that is probably because it is a little bit irregular but now if you take a look at the baseline you clearly see p waves in here

Now this is an example of computer just miscalling this. The voltage out here in big circle is maybe a little bit low:

And there is some non-specific junk and kind of a wavy baseline but hopefully whatever here is seen *there is some ST-segment elevation* in V1, AVR and also in lead 3.

... then some other non specific chunk. There is ST segment depression in Lead 1, little ST depression in AVL. There is some reciprocal changes and some flattening elsewhere. But, my question to you is - *What type of STEMI produces ST segment elevation in V1, aVR and lead III?*

That is, where does it localize in the heart? Which vessel is involved in the heart? Lets move forward a bit - if you have not got the diagnosis yet - take a look at the history
