My observation: ST segment elevation in leads 3
                ST segment depression in 1
                
Ask youself three questions:
########################################
1) Which leads have ST segment elevation?
2) What is your differential for ST segment abnormalities seen?
3) What is your most likely diagnosis?

Greetings Everyone and welecome to the ECG workout for the week of April 5th, 2021. Its Amal Mattu at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Once again, welcome back to this weeks workout. Well this week we have got two cases that focus on a single theme and both are coming to us from the great white north - from Canada. Just above the north

      - Caraquet, New Brunswick, Canada
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First case is sent by Dr Audrey Anne Gauvin. Hope I am getting your name correct. Audrey Anne works in Caraquet New Brunswick Canada. You know what - one of the things I like doing these cases is taking a look at where people are from. Now I kinda have a sense of where New Brunswick is. New Brunswick is way up here - north of maine. But where exactly is caraquet? I took up some pictures of the tourism board and I took some really nice pictures of a quaint little village or town to take a look at. Now these pictures were taken during the summer. Now, based on the location - I am guessing that they have some really cold weather also. Anyway, she sent this case in .

   *) 69 y/o W presents with CP + SOB - ECG... 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

taking care of a 69 year old woman. She has been complaining about some chest pain (CP) + and shortness of breath (SOB). My hope is for you to look at this 12 lead ECG

... and nail the diagnosis right from the start. Now take a look at this, first of all the computer interpretation up there calling it atrial fibrillation and that is probably because it is a little bit irregular but now if you take a look at the baseline you clearly see p waves in here

Now this is an example of computer just miscalling this. The voltage out here in big circle is maybe a little bit low:

And there is some non-specific junk and kind of a wavy baseline but hopefully whatever here is seen *there is some ST-segment elevation* in V1, AVR and also in lead 3.

... then some other non specific chunk. There is ST segment depression in Lead 1, little ST depression in AVL. There is some reciprocal changes and some flattening elsewhere. But, my question to you is - *What type of STEMI produces ST segment elevation in V1, aVR and lead III?*

That is, where does it localize in the heart? Which vessel is involved in the heart? Lets move forward a bit - if you have not got the diagnosis yet - take a look at the history 


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SLIDE2 >> 
 
   CASE#1
   
   *) 69 y/o W presents with CP + SOB - ECG... 
   *) Sx's x 5 days, worse today...
   *) RR 30, 90 - 92% on 100% NRB
   *) Lungs CTA, CXR normal
   *) TN normal
   *) BNP and D-dimer are elevated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. it is always fair to give the history because you always want to interpret the EKG in association with a reasonable history. So, here is the history - I cannot hide that any longer. So this patient, has been having symptoms for 5 days. And they got worse today. Respiratory rate is 30 - so that is concerning, pulse oxymeter is 90 to 92% on 100% Non-Rebreather. Maybe this patient with a STEMI has developed pulmonary edema but the lungs were clear to auscultation. Chest X-Ray was normal also. So hopefully you are heading in the proper direction. TN (troponin) is unremarkable. The BNP and D-dimer are elevated and so by this point - think, probably everyone is nailing the diagnosis.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SLIDE2 >> 
 
   CASE#1
   
   *) 69 y/o W presents with CP + SOB - ECG... 
   *) Presumptive dx PE
   *) Transferred (on heparin) to nearest CT scanner ...
      30 - 40 minutes away
   *) Dx: massive bilateral PE with right heart strain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

... presumptive diagonisis (dx) is a massive PE and is very common with elevated BNP's and large PE's and probably you inspect a bump in troponin also but later the patient also bumped the troponin. These are all signs of ventricular strain that produces elevated BNP and the rise in troponin. Audrey Ann works in a place where the nearest cat scanner is ... beleive it or not... 30 to 40 minutes away. All of here is the US really get spoiled by having CAT scanners... multiple CAT scanners sometimes in the same hospital .. she is gotta send her patient 30 to 40 minutes away just to get a CAT scanner .. that is exactly what she did. She put the patient on heparin and sent him to CAT scanner. And fortunately, the patient ended up doing OK with heparin. Now some of you might be saying - well, if you have a bed side ultrasound you can make this diagnois and that is probably true. This is not called Ultrasound workout, this is called ECG workout. So we are not going to talk about ultrasound. By all means if you have an ultrasound. It will be very helpful also. But, I really want you to look at EKG's and say to yourself.

Hey, there is ST segment elevation in the leads that are looking at the right side of the heart. Specifically, V1, AVR . Sometimes, you see in V2 also. Sometimes, you see in Lead III. 

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sashank786monitrahealth/clinical-stuffs/main/ecg-works/2021-04-April/2021-04-05/2021-04-05-005-Four-Leads-PE.png)

So those are the four leads in my mind which tell me - I have gotta worry - right heart strain. Now also, when you try to localize this for a coronary artery. There is no coronary artery that I am aware of. Maybe I am wrong, but, there is no coronary artery that I am aware of that gives you ST elevation in AVR, V1 and in the lead III. The artery that this localizes to is the pulmonary artery - not the coronary artery. So remember your differentials for ST segment elevation:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SLIDE3 >> 
 
   DDx of STE

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| Diagnosis | indication |
| :--- | :---: |
| Acute myocardial injury (ACO or trauma) | High voltage (eg. LVH, WPW, athlete's heart, etc.) |
| Global Ischemia (eg EPI, dissection, massive GIB, etc.) | Na+ channelopathies, eg. TCAs, hyperK+, Brugada, etc. |
| Early Repolarization | Post-cardioversion (stunning)|
| Myo/pericarditis | Hypothermia |
| Vasospasm | Tako tsubo |
| Ventricular aneurysm | Intracranial abnls |
| LBBB / pacemaker | Spiked Hemet sign |
| Pulmonary Embolism | Hypercalcemia |

There are a lot of things that produce a ST segment elevation. And one of them is pulmonary embolism.Always got to keep them in the differential. When you see something that has to do with chest pain, shortness of breath and ST elevation. Just think STEMI you have got to think about PE also and then we have talked about this this before as well. Differential for ST Elevation in aVR. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SLIDE4 >> 
 
   DDx for STE in aVR
   (with STD in other leads)

* ACS: LMCA, triple vessel, and prox LAD disease
* Any other causes of global cardiac ischemia
   - TAD, severe anemia, early post-arrest (w/i 15 minutes of EPI or shocks)
* Massive PE 
* LVH with strain, esp. with severe htn
* LBBB, pacers
* SVTs (esp. AVRT)
* Severe hypoK+
* Sodium channel pathology (incl. TCAs, hyperK+, Brugada, etc.)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PE can produce ST elevation in aVR as well. Every one just thinks about these bad players that produce elevation in AVR.

But there are others including massive PE.
